<h1>The Journey of Our Friendship</h1>
</header>
<section>
<p>Friendship is not always built in an instant—it grows slowly, like a seed that takes time before it blooms. Looking back, our journey together feels like a story worth telling. From those first moments of awkward silence to now, when a day feels incomplete without seeing each other, our friendship has become one of the strongest bonds in our lives.
</p>
<p>
We started out as six different individuals, unsure of how close we would eventually become. At first, conversations felt forced, and moments together sometimes ended in quiet pauses. But slowly, laughter began to fill the spaces where silence used to live. Small jokes, shared secrets, and little adventures became the foundation of something bigger—our circle of friendship.
</p>
<p>
One of the hardest moments came in Grade 8, when one of us had to move away. The group felt incomplete, and we realized how much every person mattered. But just like life always finds a way to bring people back together, Grade 9 gave us the gift of being whole again. When our friend returned, it was as if a missing piece of the puzzle had finally been found. That moment reminded us that true friends are never really separated by distance; they always find their way back.
</p>
<p>
Now, as Grade 10 students, we find ourselves at a bittersweet point. This year may be the last time we are complete as six. That thought alone makes every memory more precious. Each laugh, each lunch break, and each random conversation is something we want to hold on to, because we know that one day these moments will just be stories we’ll look back on.
</p>
<p>
Among all the memories we share, our trips to the beach hold a special place. Though they only happen once a year, those days feel magical. The sound of the waves, the warmth of the sun, and the feeling of sand beneath our feet—all of it becomes the background to our laughter and endless stories. The beach has become our yearly reminder that no matter how fast time flies, we will always find time to be together.
</p>
<p>
Our friendship has been a journey of growth, separation, reunion, and countless memories. From the awkward beginnings to the unbreakable bond we now share, we have built something that distance or time cannot easily erase. As we step into the unknown after this year, one thing is certain: we will always carry with us the laughter, the tears, the beach trips, and the bond that made us more than just friends—we became family.

<p> I may have been unlucky when it comes to love, but I am lucky when it comes to friends. They don't know that they save me and still saving me, that despite not being open about my struggles and life back then. It became bearable, knowing that they're just right here beside me. They never left me, instead they held me tightly-not willing to let go. Not willing to left any of us behind, that regardless of what the world would offer infront of us, we know, I know that i have them —that we have each other's back. May it be about heartbreaks, failed relationship, a person that we all hate, the random chikas or the random rants about life—it became more beautiful. More meaningful, because it was them who I am with. Maybe, they don't know how much they mean to me or how important they are to me. But one thing is for sure, they are the person I am willing to drop anything that I am willing to lose everything, but I can't lose them. Its true, that sometimes it feels more like home when you’re with your friends.
</p>
<p>
To the circle whom I always vent, I hope it never ends. To the relationship we always had since then, I hope it never reach the end. Because whatever happens, I will always choose all of you in every different planets. I'll keep those memories we make, because time will come that each of us will have a different pathways to take. Our future will be our priority, but no matter the distance, I will always comeback and hug all of you tightly. To the friendship that we started, to the genuine bonds that we created, I hope it never reach the end. When we're together, I know things will always get better. And I hope it will never ends.
